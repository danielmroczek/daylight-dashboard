# Daylight Dashboard

A sleek, modern web application that provides detailed information about daylight hours and sun positions for your location. Built with vanilla JavaScript and CSS variables for a responsive, system-aware dark/light theme experience.

## Project Origin

I've always preferred longer days over shorter ones. As a child, I believed the summer solstice was the happiest day of the year, and it genuinely felt that way. I dislike the transition from summer to autumn in the Northern Hemisphere, when daylight noticeably shortens. Recently, this topic frequently came up in conversations - "It's getting dark so early these days!"

I discovered lately that the summer solstice (the longest day) doesn't actually coincide with the earliest sunrise or the latest sunset - these occur on different dates. This fascinating detail inspired me to create a dashboard where people could:
- Track how daylight hours increase after winter (and celebrate accordingly)
- Monitor the shortening days as winter approaches (and plan their vitamin D supplements)
- Check if sunrise will happen before their morning commute (spoiler alert: in winter, probably not)
- Access various daylight statistics in one clean interface (because who doesn't love stats?)

Think of it as your personal almanac for the digital age, helping you stay in tune with nature's light show.
